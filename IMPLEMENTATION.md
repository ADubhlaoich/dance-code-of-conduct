# Implementation
The following is a list of events and or organisers that use or have used this [code of conduct](https://github.com/ADubhlaoich/dance-code-of-conduct/blob/master/README.md). The best place to display it is on its own page of an organisation website, though an alternate option is as a note on a facebook page, which has the added benefit of allowing people to comment on it and add questions.
