# Information
This repository contains the text for an open source code of conduct intended for partner dance events. Check the issues for specific things that need to be fixed or clarified. It was originally adapted from the code of conduct for [Fair City Blues](http://faircityblues.com/code.html), which was in turn inspired by other events.

# Code of Conduct
Our event is a social and learning experience where we want people to feel comfortable, and we aim to provide a harassment-free and safe social dance experience for everyone regardless of dance ability or background, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, physical ability, appearance, body size, race, age, religion or any other characteristics.

We take zero tolerance to harassment in any form: individuals violating these rules may be warned or expelled from the venue at the discretion of the organisers. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact any of the event organisers immediately. Ask the sign-in/registration desk if you need assistance locating an organiser.

Harassment includes deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing or intrusive 
photography or video recording, inappropriate physical contact, unsolicited affection, sexual images in public spaces, and unwelcome and unreciprocated sexual attention. When asked to stop any harassing behaviour, participants are expected to comply immediately.

Unsafe behaviour includes dipping too deeply or without permission; yanking your partner with needlessly forceful movement, excessive use of alcohol, and any form of aerials/air steps. It is perfectly acceptable to say no to a dance without reason.

While social dancing do your best to avoid colliding or interfering with other dancers. Apologise if you bump into someone and do not continue dancing until you make sure they are all right. 

## Issue Reporting
Here's what you can expect if you bring an issue to the staff; If you do not initially want action taken, but later change your mind, do not hesitate to let us know. 

* An organiser will talk you privately in confidence.
* The organiser will then document the issue.
* They will then ask you how you would like the situation to be handled.
* The individuals involved can be handled the following ways:
    * Observed but not initially approached
    * Spoken to about their behaviour 
    * Asked to leave the event
    * Reported to the legal authorities

We appreciate your assistance in keeping our events as safe as possible for everyone.
